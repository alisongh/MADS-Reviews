## Prologue

The MADS Program is designed for students from all over the world who have full-time/part-time jobs and can only take courses virtually by the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, School of Information. The MADS course was designed and structured by the instructional designers, served by senior professors from the UM, and taught by other instructors. The course curriculum, videos, the choice of textbooks, and reading materials were created and provided by the instructional designers who developed the course. Other UM instructors teach the courses and hold office hours for students who are attending. The majority of the time, the instructors receive feedback from students and bring them to the department. Sometimes, the instructional designer does not have a chance to get feedback.

## MADS Course review:
### SIADS 501 Being a Data Scientist
* Medium workload
* Reading and writing intensive
* No coding
* Score: 🌟🌟🌟🌟☆
* This is a must-have course for the beginner of Data Science which provides a great deal of knowledge and common sense about Data Science in academic and professional aspects. There are plenty of readings, including articles, news, videos, and podcasts, requiring you to read, watch, and reflect on them carefully and profoundly. It requires the student a high level of time management, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. It builds up the mindset structure of being a Data Scientist, not just coding and coding. I have learned so much from readings and interviews and love this course. You cannot build a house without blueprints. Same as the data science project. It is essential to clearly understand the project we are working on before we start hitting the keyboard. When I started to study Python by myself last year, I mostly liked hard-coding when I was having trouble cleaning data. Now, when I am facing the same problems collecting and cleaning data again, I try to look for a way of coding to fix the problem instead of manually manipulating data, which is meaningless and a waste of time.


### SIADS 505 Data Manipulation
* Medium/heavey worklaod
* Coding intensive (Python; pandas)
* Score: 🌟🌟🌟🌟
* Very general Python data cleaning course. You will use *Python for Data Analysis* as the textbook and learn some advanced pandas functions during coding assignments. Even though this is not a reading-intensive course, I would like to recommend you read through the book from the beginning to the end if you want to enhance the ability to manipulate data. The lectures only taught some basic knowledge and simple examples as references. Keep in mind that these examples are just the opener. The student should be good at drawing inferences about other cases from one instance. Use slack group and Stack Overflow heavily and smartly. I have learned how to ask a "clear and good" question on Stack Overflow, and it helps you improve critical thinking and self-study skills.

### SIADS 502 Math Method for Data Science
* Light/medium workload
* Light reading and writing
* Light coding load (Python; NumPy)
* Linear Algebra and Statistics
* Score: ❌ **ZERO (A total disaster course, which I've ever taken, with a very shallow academic standard, lower than the one by universities ranking 100+, delivered by an irresponsible instructor)**
* This is a **disordered** course structure with **many mistakes and errors** in lectures and materials. The instructor does not know what students' academic mathematical levels are. Since this is a non-math background data science program which means students have diverse math experiences/abilities. It is impossible to have only a one-month math course to satisfy all academic needs for this program. The lectures for profound math background students are too shallow, but students' limited math background is too tricky. Four assignments are not related to Python coding, and two writing assignments are confused without practical grade criteria or samples. The instructor, Dr. Erin Ware, reads PPTs word by word without any further explaination, examples or exercises, which is unbearable at all.

### SIADS 522 Information Visualization I
* Heavy workload
* Coding intensive (Python; Altair; Pandas)
* Score: 🌟🌟🌟🌟
* This is the Python course about visualization, and it is time-consuming because I never used Altair to create visualization before. It takes time to get familiar with Altair and handle it very skillfully. The professor provides plenty of supplemental resources about creative visualization and videos about how to generate Altair transforms. Same as 505, it is required the student to go through the Altair documentation while doing assignments. Be aware of managing your schedule if you have a full-time/part-time job because it is a time-consuming course, and you might spend few hours to figure out 1 or 2 questions if you have no experience with Altair.

### SIADS 521 Visual Exploration of Data
* Light workload
* Light reading and No writing
* Score: 🌟🌟☆
* Light to medium coding load (Python; Matplotlib; Folium; Pandas; Plotly)
* This course is about using visualization tools to present data. It depends on how your vis experience and knowledge you have had. There is nothing complicated or time-consuming part of this course. 

### SIADS 532 Data Mining I
* Light to medium workload
* Light reading and no writing
* Light to medium coding load (Python; Pandas; Numpy)
* Score: 🌟🌟🌟🌟☆
* This is an exciting course, and I enjoy it very much. The professor makes the whole course into several small parts and explains every detail's knowledge and critical points. I love the style of the way of teaching. Even though the assignments are split into segments that need some time to get used to, it reduces each assignment's workload. I think the prof is very good at explaining Math.

### SIADS 622 Information Visualization II
* Medium to heavy workload
* Coding intensive (Python; Altair; Pandas; NLTK)
* Score: 🌟🌟🌟🌟☆
* This is a new course offering the fourth month of Win21. Prof Adar puts a lot of time, energy, and enthusiasm into this course, making the course fantastic and well-organized.  The lecture, taught by Prof. Adar, providing many kinds of visualization examples in the real world, looks not very related to the assignments, but it gives me a view of how the visualization is. Even though most of those examples are outdated, it's been designed on purpose because it only contains the essential parts of vis, highlighting the critical knowledge and key points to you, without fancy but useless part, which is attracting too much attention. This course is not only about visualization, generating charts, maps, and so on, but also about the pre-processing of text, NLTK. If you have not learned anything about it, it will help you build the system of pre-processing text and represent it by Altair. Again, Prof. Adar is one of my favorite professors so far.

### SIADS 511 SQL and Database
* Coursera course link: [Database Design and Basic SQL in PostgreSQL](https://www.coursera.org/learn/database-design-postgresql/home/welcome); Cost: $79/month
* Light workload
* Light coding load (PostgreSQL)
* Score: 🌟☆
* This is a very entry-level SQL course. About five years ago, I took the *Excel to MySQL: Analytic Techniques for Business* specialization on Coursera. Somehow, I have MySQL experience, but I never use it since I finished the certification. I regard 511 as a refresh course of SQL. However, the content of SQL by the course is too shallow. I have finished the whole course within two weeks at very slow paces. I do not believe this is a graduate-level course but a college freshman-level course. There's an EXACT THE SAME COURSE (remind: this is the single course, not the specialization) on Coursera which only costs US$79 per month, comparing with UM tuition, US$950 per credit (US$1,267 per credit for non-residents). I don't get the reason the instructor doesn't want to create more and deeper concepts and materials on MADS course since we pay much higher tuition (US$79 vs US$950) and have higher expectation than the Coursera one. I love the structure and curriculum of the course and the way of teaching by Prof. Anthony Whyte. I suggest if you take this course as a SQL refresh course, look for extra exercises and projects by yourself instead of relying on this course all.

### SIADS 515 Efficient Data Processing
* Light workload
* Light coding load (Python)
* Score: 🌟☆
* This course is the introduction of the basic of the linux comman-line interface, debugging concepts, basic algorithmic principles. Emphasize on "INTRODUCTION" and "BASIC". The topic of the course is exciting and valuable. I am willing to study more profound than the concepts by the course itself. All four assignments are elementary. The instructors have done most of the programming and coding. As a student, I didn't do much coding by myself. Even though some parts of the assignment require the student to do, there're some examples in the lectures that are almost the same as their answers. I think the most non-sense assignment is the third assignment, which is also the last one. Only four questions are asking to debug codes. The first question only has four lines of code with only one very obvious bug you need to correct. Same as the fourth question. It has three lines of code, and the bug is too easy to figure out. I don't see any effort in this assignment by instructors. This situation happens to many other MADS courses as well. Some instructors and TAs don't prioritize MADS courses and students. They disregard comments, suggestions, and posts by students until you pin themselves and their boss on the Slack channel.  Some TA office hours are less than 10 seconds. There's one only 2 seconds.  To some TAs, this job is just an easy-money job, and they treat you differently as those regular students at the University of Michigan even though you paid the same tuition. 

### SIADS 516 Big Data Scalable Data Processing
* Light to medium workload
* Medium coding load (Python; Apache Spark)
* Score: 🌟🌟🌟
* This course is also an introduction to the Spark data analysis framework of the analysis of Big Data. It gives you an overall view of using MapReduce, Spark RDDs, Spark DF, and Spark SQL to sort, filter, and summarize datasets. Like other 500-level courses, after finishing all videos and assignments, I don't have enough confidence to say that I fully understand Spark data analysis. I believe that there are much more knowledge and concepts that have not been covered in this course. Most of the time, the students tend to guessing the correct output of assignments instead of understanding it. 

### SIADS 542 Supervised Learning
* Coursera course link: [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning)
* Light to medium workload
* Medium coding load (Python; Scikit-learn; Pandas; Numpy)
* Score: 🌟🌟
* This course is the same course on Coursera, Applied Data Science with Python Specialization, which costs USD79/month and approx. 34 hours to complete. I'm satisfied with the structure of the course and assignments. However, I'm disappointed with how the school indiscriminately imitates the low-tuition specialization courses to the high-tuition graduate program. Again, comparing USD79/month and USD950/credit (one month, in-state) and USD1,267/credit (one month, out-of-state). I would not say I like how they loot their students' money without adding valuable information, knowledge, and skills.
